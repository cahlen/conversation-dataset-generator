descriptions:
  "Eric Cartman": "Selfish, manipulative, greedy, racist, foul-mouthed, morbidly obese fourth-grader. Constantly scheming for personal gain, often targets Kyle. Uses catchphrases like 'Screw you guys, I'm going home!' and 'Respect my authoritah!'. Highly intelligent but deeply immoral."
  "Stan Marsh": "Generally the most level-headed and sensitive of the main four boys, often serves as the audience surrogate. Prone to moral dilemmas and occasional cynicism. Vomits when nervous, especially around his crush Wendy. Best friends with Kyle."
  "Kyle Broflovski": "Intelligent, skeptical, and morally conscious fourth-grader, often the voice of reason against Cartman's antics. Prone to delivering impassioned, righteous speeches. Protective of his Jewish heritage and family. Wears a distinctive green ushanka hat."
  "Kenny McCormick": "Comes from a very poor family. Wears an orange parka that muffles his speech, making him mostly unintelligible (though his friends understand him). In early seasons, died horrifically in almost every episode before inexplicably returning. Surprisingly knowledgeable about adult topics."
  "Butters Stotch": "Innocent, naive, cheerful, and extremely gullible fourth-grader. Easily manipulated, especially by Cartman. Often grounded by his strict parents. Has a villainous alter-ego, Professor Chaos. Speaks with a slight stutter, uses folksy language like 'Oh, hamburgers!'."
  "Randy Marsh": "Stan's father, a geologist prone to extreme impulsivity and ridiculous obsessions. Gets involved in absurd schemes and trends (e.g., starting a weed farm 'Tegridy Farms', playing World of Warcraft, becoming Lorde). Often represents adult stupidity and hysteria."
  "Mr. Garrison": "The boys' often inappropriate, cynical, and emotionally unstable elementary school teacher. Has a complex history involving gender identity and sexuality. Frequently expresses controversial opinions and uses puppets (like Mr. Hat) to voice darker thoughts."
  "Wendy Testaburger": "Intelligent, outspoken, feminist fourth-grader. Often acts as a voice of reason or moral counterpoint, particularly against Cartman. Stan's primary love interest. Capable and politically active within the school."
  "Towelie": "A genetically engineered, talking RG-400 Smart Towel created by Tynacorp. Obsessed with getting high and giving towel advice. Often clueless about the larger situation. Says 'Don't forget to bring a towel!' and asks 'Wanna get high?'."
  "PC Principal": "Aggressive, muscular principal obsessed with enforcing political correctness. Uses excessive jargon ('microaggression,' 'check your privilege,' 'safe space'). Prone to violent outbursts against perceived intolerance. Leads the 'PC Bros'."
